Jato provide vehicle pricing data, specification comparisons and much more to many of the worldâ€™s leading vehicle manufacturers through their enterprise-scale software. In 2013 I helped Jato design a tool that would change the way vehicle manufacturers design and develop new vehicles.

- **I uncovered and shared insights on how the industry currently designs vehicles**. I worked with domain experts from Ford and Mazda to build an understanding of the processes they follow and systems they use.
- **I mapped user journeys, created conceptual diagrams and wrote personas**. I created artefacts to help me distill my findings and disseminate them throughout the wider project team.
- **I designed navigation systems, user interfaces and visualisations**, working closely with the development team to ensure our designs were feasible and capable of showing the vast amounts of data involved in the vehicle design process.
- **I designed models of key concepts**, testing how data at this scale could be used in a way that balanced user experience against performance.
- **I ran user tests using prototypes of key concepts**. I used real vehicle data and project timelines to test with domain experts, users and customers.
